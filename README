 FTD2XX
========

ftd2xx is a simple python wrapper around the D2XX DLL from FTDI using
ctypes. It is based on Pablo Bleyer's d2xx_ extension.

I am no longer developing this, but am accepting patches. If you want
to maintain the library, please let me know.

There is a more actively maintained library by Ben Bass called
pylibftdi_ that you may be interested in.
