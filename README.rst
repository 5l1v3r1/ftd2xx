FTD2XX
======

The previous person who agreed to take over maintenance has become unresponsive. I am calling this the official repo until I find a new maintainer.

ftd2xx is a simple python wrapper around the `D2XX DLL`_ from FTDI using
ctypes. It is based on Pablo Bleyer Kocik's d2xx_ extension.

There is a more actively maintained library by Ben Bass called
pylibftdi_ that you may be interested in.
