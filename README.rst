FTD2XX
======

I don't have time to maintain this project, so looking I am looking for a maintainer. 

ftd2xx is a simple python wrapper around the `D2XX DLL`_ from FTDI using
ctypes. It is based on Pablo Bleyer Kocik's d2xx_ extension.

There another library by Ben Bass called pylibftdi_ that may fit your needs better.
