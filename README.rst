FTD2XX
======

Krishna Sudhakar has kindly agreed to continue development. Please see https://github.com/ctrl-shift-esc/ftd2xx.git .

ftd2xx is a simple python wrapper around the `D2XX DLL`_ from FTDI using
ctypes. It is based on Pablo Bleyer Kocik's d2xx_ extension.

There is a more actively maintained library by Ben Bass called
pylibftdi_ that you may be interested in.
